A couple of important notes:
. The email verification now works - please check your spam/junk folders!
. Currently, linking your OJINGEO Player account to the OJINGEO PROJECT game is unavalible. Update for this will be released soon! Sign up to recieve some in game exclusives!
. Website is constantly being updated to look nice, please do not remove this account.
. Language support coming soon.
. OJINGEO PROJECT is in extremley early access so expect a ton of bugs.


Todays web updates:
Added a shop page (You can only use In-game currency. Log in to view progress & purchases).
Added a new media page for trailers, more screenshots, e.t.c.
Brought back the smooth fade transition between switching the pages.
Brought back the "Link Account to game" button.
Added a new benefits area to showcase the benefits of linking your OJINGEO account to OJINGEO PROJECT.

Please note my coding skills aren't perfect, so things may be removed accidently as i keep updating this.
